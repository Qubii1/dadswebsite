            <p>“There are so many memories I can think of that I’d consider my favorite, but I always come back to the time Dad played Star Fox with us. At that time, Dad was sooooo much better than we were at the game, so much so that he felt the need to pay us to fight him. Secretly, he never had to pay me; I just enjoyed the gambling. I remember waking up early on Saturday and Sunday mornings, eager and excited for Dad to wake up, make me an egg sandwich (or grilled cheese, depending on how late he woke up, lol), and play against us. It always makes me so happy looking back on it. Dad really made it a precious time in my life.”</p>

            <p>“My favorite memories with dad are when we used to watch a little house on the prairie together and he used to teach me everything about the time period and the actors. He used to say that he always wanted a daughter like Laura Ingalls but little did he know he would get an even badder bitch like me;) He also said he wanted to be a dad like Charles Ingalls but he turned out to be an even badder bitch too! I remember coming home and getting so excited to have lunch with dad so that we could watch our show together, and when I come home to visit now I get so excited to relive those amazing times!”</p>

            <p>“I always loved when Dad would play with the dogs, especially with Blake. Seeing him get so much joy out of making Blake chase his tail or making him chase the sunlight or the water hose filled me with so much joy. With Trinity, even seeing him pet her was like witnessing the end of a war where the two sides finally reach a peace agreement. Kyra and Dalton will know the feeling. It was so special to me because of how much they constantly annoyed him all the time. It felt so wholesome to witness those moments where you could tell deep down he loved Blake and Trinity so much.”</p>

            <p>“There are so many qualities I admire about Mom, but one that usually stands out is her compassion. Regardless of how we, or anybody treated her, she is always the first one to reach out and show compassion, and boy did we irritate the crap out of her at times. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, and continue to make them today. Mom has always been there to listen judgment-free, and has never failed to empathize. Her emotional intelligence is immense for somebody who has lived the life she has; that kind of resilience is extremely rare in this world full of trauma victims. Mom has big feelings, and she is never afraid to share them with us and with the world.”</p>

            <p>“There's so many to choose from but I think the one I always find myself in awe of is her resilience. I am stunned at how through every hardship, she found a way to overcome it. When she shares stories with me of her past, it sometimes feels like she is one person up against an army of a million giants and somehow she always comes out on top and I admire that because so many people would just give up or accept defeat, but mom always puts up a fight. She always calls out the things she thinks are wrong and unjust. That type of resilience is something I don't think I could ever replicate but it pushes me to not ever give up in life. Even when things get really hard, or when the world feels extremely bleak.”</p>

            <p>“Mom’s compassion 100% determined how I live my life today. She has been and always will be my model for empathy, consistently showing understanding and care for others’ feelings, and encouraging others to do the same. Mom’s compassion also inspired me to do the little things that matter, like holding the door, listening actively, or helping someone in need. Finally, Mom’s compassion is how I learned vulnerability.”</p>

            <p>“My open-mindedness. Since I was very young I always noticed that whenever mom would see someone very different from her, instead of avoiding them and getting uncomfortable, it felt like she saw the beauty in that difference, and always jumped at the opportunity to understand them without judgement. I do this without even having to think about it. She instilled in me a curiosity for diverse perspectives that I think is so important and I’m grateful to have that sort of empathy because of her.”</p>

There are so many people with power who use it for the worst things imaginable, and thanks to Mom, I know how to stand up for what I believe is right.”</p>

This taught me to be more present in people's lives. Even just telling someone you’re thinking about them or you hope they are doing ok means so much. I also always try to tell people what makes them so great because Mom always reminds me of what makes me great and it always puts a smile on my face or gives me a boost of confidence.”</p>

Working with her at Regency showed me just how difficult her day-to-day life was at the time. Sure, Mom’s current job is still taxing and demanding, but she gets to travel and manifest beautiful new experiences. I am just really proud that she decided to benefit herself for once, I know how deeply selfless she is and to put herself out there and land the job she has for the city was freaking awesome.
