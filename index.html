            <p>“There are so many memories I can think of that I’d consider my favorite, but I always come back to the time Dad played Star Fox with us. At that time, Dad was sooooo much better than we were at the game, so much so that he felt the need to pay us to fight him. Secretly, he never had to pay me; I just enjoyed the gambling. I remember waking up early on Saturday and Sunday mornings, eager and excited for Dad to wake up, make me an egg sandwich (or grilled cheese, depending on how late he woke up, lol), and play against us. It always makes me so happy looking back on it. Dad really made it a precious time in my life.”</p>

            <p>“My favorite memories with dad are when we used to watch a little house on the prairie together and he used to teach me everything about the time period and the actors. He used to say that he always wanted a daughter like Laura Ingalls but little did he know he would get an even badder bitch like me;) He also said he wanted to be a dad like Charles Ingalls but he turned out to be an even badder bitch too! I remember coming home and getting so excited to have lunch with dad so that we could watch our show together, and when I come home to visit now I get so excited to relive those amazing times!”</p>

            <p>“I always loved when Dad would play with the dogs, especially with Blake. Seeing him get so much joy out of making Blake chase his tail or making him chase the sunlight or the water hose filled me with so much joy. With Trinity, even seeing him pet her was like witnessing the end of a war where the two sides finally reach a peace agreement. Kyra and Dalton will know the feeling. It was so special to me because of how much they constantly annoyed him all the time. It felt so wholesome to witness those moments where you could tell deep down he loved Blake and Trinity so much.”</p>

            <p>“Anything Dad does is funny honestly. Remember when he used to curse in gibberish like that guy from Home Alone? Or whenever an old lady or big dude or any wacky character would walk around, he would give them a funny (sometimes highly offensive) nickname and make up their voices. Or literally any fart or poop joke he has ever made. The most recent funny thing I can think of was when we were all playing badminton, and he was like this hulk of a dude with a tiny racquet. He got so frustrated when he couldn’t hit it right (sorry, Dad, it was super funny).

            <p>“I got all of my humor from dad so it’s hard to pick just one thing. I’ll list some things off though, first hoop earrings! Nothing makes me laugh more than when dad makes sure his characters have hoop earrings. It’s so stupid but I think that’s my favorite kind of humor. I love how every single thing that I think is funny dad always gets a kick out of, even though he is a reputable scientist he doesn’t take life too seriously and that is my favorite way to go through life.

            <p>“Honorable mention to the hoop earrings. Reading Kyra’s response actually made me laugh out loud for a good 10 seconds. By far some of the funniest shit that has ever existed on this earth. I don’t even know how he came up with that. But anyway I think for me another big one is the fact that he seems like he could easily fit in Gen Z. Like the time he said “slay” and “demure” just instinctively not even knowing that those are popular slang words from our generation. Me and J talk about that all the time and we are still obsessed with it.

            <p>“ Dad has taught me every life lesson there is, even when I for some reason decided to f around and find out for myself. But above all, Dad taught me how to always step up and be there for the people you love. He also taught me that there is usually a logical explanation for most things, and to calm down and think in difficult times. I’m extremely emotionally sensitive, so this sorta saved me in many situations. Finally, if I ever become a Dad, I feel confident thanks to my own. Dad is the best role model anyone could ask for when it comes to being a father.

          <div class="kyra answer">
            <h4>Kyra</h4>
            <p>“ Dad has taught me how to be humble. At first I thought that this was just some basic advice but he represents it in everything he does. He always told us that he and mom love us more than anything but when we get out in the world we have to earn others' love and it isn’t owed to us. This helps me to make amazing friendships because I don’t think that I am better than anyone else and I don’t think that anyone is better than me. This means that I truly appreciate people for who they are and not how they boost my ego. I think this is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned in life and I had an amazing example to show me how to live this way.

            <h4>Quinn</h4>
            <p>“To always make sure and question everything. Growing up Dad would never take anything at face value and would always dig deeper into everything to make sure he is basically an expert in something before he feels comfortable to engage with it. I believe that asking questions is one of the most important things you can do in life. It’s taught me to not accept things as is. If something doesn’t make sense to me (capitalism) I have the confidence now to question it. I cherish this so much and I definitely attribute this to observing how Dad carries himself in the world.

He seems to always have an answer to everything, even the most impossible situations (I promise I don’t try to trip him up). Even currently, Dad is helping me with things. I was so disappointed in myself for needing his help again. I kept things secret so that I could try to handle things on my own, and instead, I dug myself a deeper hole. When I opened up to him, he was just there; he didn’t make me feel ashamed or sad, he didn’t show anger towards me, he just analyzed and came up with a plan to help. Most people would be (validly) upset, but Dad was just there for me. I’m not sure if I can ever pay him back for what he has done for me, but I won’t let it stop me from trying.

The times that meant the most to me was whenever I was sick. Everytime I had appendicitis, dad would stay home with me and feed me crackers and hang out with me as I had to occasionally run to the bathroom to puke. Recently dad stayed on the phone with me while he was at work as I was depressed from not being able to surf because of a migraine. He stayed on the phone with me the entire four hours I was waiting for my migraine to go away and it helped with my sadness of missing out on surfing for my one day off. I can’t even emphasize how much I appreciated this and every other time as well!”</p>

I remember I lost my airpods and I was devastated and I know that makes me sound like a full fledged c**t, but music is so important to me and losing airpods is like losing a car. They are so expensive. But at some point I just gave up looking for them and I was so sad, but the next day I came into my room to find brand new airpod pros on my bed and I was literally in shock. That meant the actual world to me and for Dad to know that, made me feel very loved and I will never forget that.

            <p>“Love. Although dad is extremely caring to all people, he is very selective with who he loves, and when he loves someone he does it more unconditionally than what I thought was humanly possible. He drops his ego completely with everything he does, so when he loves someone it isn’t to make himself feel loved, it’s to love them in their rawest form, flaws and all. He gets mad at us for making mistakes, but it is so clear that he doesn’t want any harm to come our way in life and he hurts to see us have to deal with the consequences of our mistakes. I try to love others the same way even though it doesn’t come as naturally to me as it does for him. LOVE YOU DAD!!

Growing up I surrounded myself with friends who displayed extreme toxic masculinity which made me not ever wanna be around men, and it made me hate myself for being a man. But the more and more time I spend around Dad, the more and more I realize that I choose what type of man I am. Dad never fails to be there for the people he loves. Dad will sacrifice anything and everything to make sure we are ok. Dad is extremely loyal. Dad stays calm in times of extreme emotion, not because he doesn’t feel those emotions just as much as anyone else, but because he wants to be our rock. Dad not only makes me feel proud to be a man, but also inspires me to try and be half the man he is, so i can go out in the world and set the example for all the incel bums out there ”</p>
